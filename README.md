# Embedded C Programming Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Embedded C Programming**. Throughout this repository, I will be posting code snippets, projects, and notes related to Embedded C, with a focus on real-world applications in embedded systems. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of Embedded C code that demonstrates how to interface with hardware, handle system resources efficiently, and develop reliable embedded systems.

Projects will include simulations using **Proteus Software** and development with **Keil uVision**.

## Repository Contents:
- **Code**: Various Embedded C programs and projects, ranging from basic concepts to complex applications.
- **Notes**: Learning materials and explanations regarding embedded systems concepts, microcontroller programming, and low-level programming techniques.
- **Examples**: Practical examples of Embedded C applications, such as interfacing with sensors, handling interrupts, working with timers, and communicating via protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C.
- **Simulations**: Projects simulated using **Proteus Software** to demonstrate hardware behavior.

## Getting Started
To get started with the code in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary development tools (e.g., **Keil uVision**, **Proteus Software**).
3. Refer to the specific project README files for setup instructions and code walkthroughs.

## Progress
This section will be updated regularly with each new project added. Here's what I've worked on so far:
- **Project 1**: Basic LED Blink - A simple LED blink program to get started with microcontroller I/O.
- **Project 2**: Temperature Sensor Interface - Interfacing a temperature sensor with a microcontroller.
- **Project 3**: UART Communication - Setting up serial communication between two devices.

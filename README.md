Welcome to my **Embedded C Programming** repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Embedded C, focusing on real-world applications, hardware interfacing, and low-level programming. I will be posting code snippets, projects, and notes related to embedded systems, along with simulations using **Proteus Software** and development with **Keil uVision**. 🚀

## Repository Contents 📂
- **Code**: Various Embedded C programs and projects, ranging from basic concepts to complex applications. 💻
- **Notes**: Learning materials and explanations on embedded systems concepts, microcontroller programming, and low-level techniques. 📚
- **Examples**: Practical examples, such as interfacing with sensors, handling interrupts, working with timers, and communication protocols like UART, SPI, and I2C. ⚡
- **Simulations**: Projects simulated using **Proteus Software** to demonstrate hardware behavior. 🛠️

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started with the code in this repository:
